I have created a 3D printed tray for either a cell phone or a hiking
compass that can be mounted on a Mach2GTO.  The tray consists of two
parts:

* **A mounting attachment** that slides onto the Mach2GTO and
  clamped to it with 3D printed screw.
  
* **Tray** that is is either for a hiking compass or a cell
  phone. Since cell phones come in many sizes, the user will have to
  modify the OpenSCAD code in _source/mach2gto_compass.scad_ for their
  phone. See README in the _source_ directory for guidance as to what
  to change.
  * The hiking compass that I used is the _Sun Company ProMap Compass_
    available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Company-ProMap-Compass-Orienteering/dp/B0BSB7CK6H/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ZWZMW4UPDAT9&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PTZqovFsVuQk3P45Le2lTuAsgPY44nySoG10m8s-QUuoT1wN7dO-BFimQgfy31KC_YmA8sLe666aclBQXb9lEbcNqpF3awJ3ZINpGZ0XESWjY2NOR7VNBA1JpDoWsMifdDZDIUJLesX8HBHJGt1RxLk3mVy5rUpbl2KBz1uPtOPo6wgXmPjslWVs-K_GiZJGgon0kJY_P5RN482iRCkKOnEb71ZqvgoTGo_J1YwDRO4qFGxL4XH927XOVDhtrkYt692_lA3Ms2lrfuJUiz-jFO6ViczCguzPnb_2_r6vVZA.qHjP3ISotJTO9xLwJP26toHr-h7VLB3HC0Cjn3-bgD4&dib_tag=se&keywords=Sun+Company+ProMap+Compass&qid=1731036913&sprefix=sun+company+promap+compass%2Caps%2C430&sr=8-1)
