# STL files

by C.Y. Tan 2024

These STL files were created with
[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html) version 2024.11.04
from the source code in the _source_ directory. These files are loaded
into a slicer program like the [Ultimaker
CURA](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/) for 3D printing.

## Common STL files

The following STL files are common for every type of possible trays:

* **clamp_screw.stl** the clamp screw.
* **mount_attachment.stl** the mount attachment.

## Hiking compass tray

This tray fits the hiking compass made by _Sun Company ProMap Compass_
    available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Company-ProMap-Compass-Orienteering/dp/B0BSB7CK6H/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ZWZMW4UPDAT9&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PTZqovFsVuQk3P45Le2lTuAsgPY44nySoG10m8s-QUuoT1wN7dO-BFimQgfy31KC_YmA8sLe666aclBQXb9lEbcNqpF3awJ3ZINpGZ0XESWjY2NOR7VNBA1JpDoWsMifdDZDIUJLesX8HBHJGt1RxLk3mVy5rUpbl2KBz1uPtOPo6wgXmPjslWVs-K_GiZJGgon0kJY_P5RN482iRCkKOnEb71ZqvgoTGo_J1YwDRO4qFGxL4XH927XOVDhtrkYt692_lA3Ms2lrfuJUiz-jFO6ViczCguzPnb_2_r6vVZA.qHjP3ISotJTO9xLwJP26toHr-h7VLB3HC0Cjn3-bgD4&dib_tag=se&keywords=Sun+Company+ProMap+Compass&qid=1731036913&sprefix=sun+company+promap+compass%2Caps%2C430&sr=8-1)
	
* **hiking_compass_tray.stl** the tray that fits the Sun Company
  ProMap compass.

## Specialized STL files

I made a iphone tray for my iPhone SE. Here's the STL file. Note:
  Every iPhone generation may have slightly different dimensions and
  so the OpenSCAD source code have to be modified for your iPhone.

* **iphone_tray.stl** the tray that fits the iPhone SE with case.
